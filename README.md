Hotel Management System
Objective:

The Hotel Management System is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to streamline room booking, management, and customer handling in hotels.

Features:

1.View All Rooms: Displays all room details, including type, price, and booking status.

2.Book Room: Allows booking of rooms by entering customer details and room number.

3.Check Out: Marks booked rooms as available for future customers.

4.Filter Rooms: Shows only available rooms for easy identification.

5.Add New Rooms: Dynamically adds new rooms with user-defined details like room type and price.

How It's Done:

The application is developed using the Python programming language and the tkinter library for creating a user-friendly graphical interface.

1.Backend: A dictionary structure is used to store and manage room details.

2.Frontend: tkinter components such as labels, buttons, entry fields, and tables (ttk.Treeview) are used for the GUI.

3.Functionality: Includes event-driven programming to handle user actions like booking, checkout, and adding new rooms.

Technical Highlights:

1.Modular design with separate functions for booking, checkout, and adding rooms.

2.Dynamic updates to room data displayed in the table.

3.Error handling for invalid operations, such as double booking or checking out unbooked rooms.
